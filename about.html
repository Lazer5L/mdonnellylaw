						<h3>Helping you plan your future</h3>
						<p>Attorney Meghan A. Donnelly grew up right here in the Stateline area. In 2012, Attorney Donnelly graduated from Marquette University Law School. Upon graduation, she was admitted to the Wisconsin State Bar while she studied for the Bar Exam in Illinois. In 2013, Attorney Donnelly passed the Illinois Bar Exam and became licensed to practice law in Illinois as well.</p>
						<p>Having dual licences, Attorney Donnelly decided to return to her community and open her own law firm in June of 2014. Attorney Donnelly has a passion for helping families (of any age) get their affairs in order to provide peace of mind going forward no matter what happens. For families with minor children, this includes making sure that their children are taken care of both financially and personally should something happen to them. For older generation families, this includes ensuring that all of their assets go to whom they wish, as smoothly as possible, when the time comes.</p>
						<p>Attorney Donnelly is also here to help her clientâ€™s through tough financial times. Unfortunately, for many, bills tend to pile up and get uncontrollable. Attorney Donnelly is here to help you regain control through either negotiation or can help you through the Bankruptcy process, should the need arise. </p>
						<p>On the business end, Attorney Donnelly has had vast experience in drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts. She is able to help you through all of your business needs. </p>
						<p>If you are in need of an experienced and trustworthy attorney, please reach out and I would be happy to be of assistance.   </p>
